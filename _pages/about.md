I'm a husband to a beautiful and amazing woman and father to two amazing children. I love running and baking bread, almost as much as I love eating it. I have a passion for the world of IT and most things that entails. From networking, to servers, to development I enjoy them all. My focus though is large data center IT.

I begun my journey in IT as a young high schooler taking Cisco CCNA classes. I was a typical band geek with aspirations of being the next Wynton Marsalis. As I neared the end of my time at highschool I was lost and didn't know where I wanted to go. One day my CCNA instructor asked what my next steps were? what was I going to go to college for? I sat there pondering the question with no idea what to tell her. The following days I thought about it and being called out I knew I needed an answer. So the next class while I was explaining how I was setting up my networks she stops me and says "I know what field you need to go into". She goes on to explain that my face glows whenever I talk about technology and that she can see the passion and love for it. Though I loved music, she was right, I needed to do this. The rest is as they say history.
